    <h3>10 November 2010</h3>

    <p>
        Te Houtaewa was the fastest runner of his day and played many pranks on
        <br>
        his peoples enemies. One morning his mother wanted kumara for the hangi
        <br>
        (earth oven) and asked Te Houtaewa to go to the gardens at Te Kao, a short
        <br>
        distance away. He agreed to fetch the kumara and told his mother to
        <br>
        prepare the hangi.
    </p>
    <p>
        Instead of going to the nearby gardens, Te Houtaewa set off for Ahipara as
        <br>
        he wanted to annoy some Te Rarawa people who lived there. Carrying two
        <br>
        large baskets for the kumara, he ran like the wind, completing the journey
        <br>
        over the hard sands of Te Oneroa a Tohe (Ninety Mile Beach) in the few
        <br>
        hours it takes a good hangi to heat up properly. On reaching Ahipara, he
        <br>
        went straight to the people's kumara pataka (storehouse for the sweet
        <br>
        potatoes) situated at the foot of the hill Whangatauatia.
    </p>
    <p>
        While Te Houtaewa was filling his baskets with kumara he was spotted
        <br>
        stealing the kai (food). He was immediately recognised.
