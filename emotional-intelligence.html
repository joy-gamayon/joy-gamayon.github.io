    <h2> What is Emotional Intelligence?</h2>
    <p>
        Based on what I have read and from research sources, Emotional intelligence (EI) or we can also called as Emotional quotient (EQ), is about having
        <br> 
        the ability to understand, recognize and manage our own emotions, as well as the emotions of other people. Possessing such skills set could nagivate 
        <br>
        our social interactions effectively, handle stressful situations, can communicate with empathy and making decisions through emotional cues.
        <br>
        There are key components of emotional intellgence which are important skills set to possess, as it navigates our learning journey at Dev Academy. 
        <br>
        Hence, it can help us become more successful in Web Development industry.
        <br>
        These skills set are having the ability to become aware of ourselves like recognizing and understanding our own feelings and thoughts, strengths, weakness, motivations and our values.
        <br> 
        To be able to manage and control our own emotions, impulse, and our reaction towards feelings and certain problems or situations, which are challenging for us.
        <br>
        To become aware and mindful to those people surround us, by being empathetic and undestanding their emotions, perspective in life and needs.
        <br>
        Thus, emotional intelligence plays a crucial role in various aspects of life, including personal relationships, leadership, teamwork, and overall well-being. 
        <br>
        I believe people with high emotional intelligence would normally possess great leadership capabilities, internpersonal relationships and resilience when faced obstacles.
        <br>
        Additionally, they can effectively adapt to rapid changes within the environment and can handle stress more constructively.
        <br>
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>How is EQ different to IQ?</h2>
    <br>
    <p>
        For my understanding, Emotional Intelligence (EQ) and Intelligence Quotient (IQ) are both measures of human abilities, but they differ in their focus and what they measure.
        <br>
        Regarding Intelligence Quotient(IQ), this (IQ) mainly measures and focuses on the cognitive abilities of a person through problem-solving, mathematical ability,
        <br>
        logical reasoning, and verbal comprehension. While emotional intelligence (IQ) focuses on the ability of oneself and others by being able to recognize, understand,
        <br>
        manage, and express emotions effectively,  as well as the ability to navigate social interactions and relationships. In addtion, we merely based IQ for 
        <br>
        intellgence tests in assessing our cognitive abilities through tasks such as memory tests, puzzles, pattern recognition etc. On the other hand, EQ is more enclose
        <br>
        for possessing self-awareness, self-regulation, social awareness and relationship management. Which focuses on emotional skills rather than cognitive abilities of a person.
        <br>
        Therefore, IQ focuses on cognitive side of a person's abilities, while EQ focuses on emotional skills. Both are important for overall success and well-being,
        <br>
        but they represent different aspects of human intelligence and abilities.
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>Why is EQ important?</h2>
    <br>
    <p>
        In terms of learning, posessing Emotional Intelligence (EQ) would be a helpful tool in handling our stress, worries, 
        <br>
        and improving our relationship with peers. As we would be able to recognize and regulate our emotions.
        <br>
        Hence, stress can be manageable and we can remain resilient in challenging situations. 
        <br>
        We also have better interpersonal relationships, as we become more empathetic and understanding towards people, and able to control or manage conflicts.
        <br>
        Thus, this leads to stronger connections with colleagues, friends, and family members. 
        <br>
        In addition, a higher chance of becoming successful to any career paths we take, as possing EQ is increasingly valued in the workforce.
        <br>
        This is because people with high EQ can easily adapt to changing environments, communicate effectively, and
        <br>
        can work well in teams. Which is the most essential assets to have in every company in order to ultimately contribute to organizational success.
        <br>
        Overall, emotional intelligence is essential for navigating the complexities of human interactions, fostering positive relationships, 
        <br>
        and achieving personal and professional success. It's a skill that can be developed and improved over time, 
        <br>
        making it a valuable asset for individuals in all areas of life.
