    <h3>A bit about myself and why I chose Dev Academy</h3>  
    <p>Hello Karaka fam, my name is Joy and I resided in the coal town of Huntly. Lately, I've been contemplating the intersection of authenticity and societal expectations in shaping one's identity. I believe that staying true to oneself while navigating societal norms and expectations can be a challenging yet rewarding journey. <br>
    I've chosen to attend Dev Academy because of my partner. He's in IT field and he is also interested in learning Web development, but at the moment he's just focusing at his new job. I know it would be great to study and to go through this journey together. He was the one who introduced me to this Academy and encouraged me to start my web development journey. I have been interested in this field due to its flexibilty to work remotely like my partner right now. I am passionate about technology and its potential to drive positive change in the world. I see Dev Academy as an opportunity to deepen my skills in software development, collaborate with like-minded individuals, and contribute to innovative projects that align with my values. I'm excited to immerse myself in a supportive learning environment where I can grow both personally and professionally while making meaningful contributions to the tech community.</p> <br>

        <h3>Add HTML and CSS to your Blog Challenge</h3>

        
<h4>1. Write a small story about HTML and CSS and their relationship. You could personify elements or speak from your own personal experience. The story should capture insight about the nature of HTML and CSS. </h4><br> 
<p>
Once upon a time in the vast kingdom of the World Wide Web, there existed two inseparable friends named HTML and CSS. HTML, short for HyperText Markup Language, was the backbone of every webpage. It provided the structure, the bones upon which the content was built. CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, was HTML's faithful companion, bringing beauty and elegance to their creations. 
<br>
HTML was a practical and straightforward fellow. He loved organizing things, creating hierarchies, and laying out the foundation of their web projects. With his tags and elements, he defined headings, paragraphs, lists, and more. HTML was like the architect of the web, carefully planning and constructing the framework for their digital world.<br>

CSS, on the other hand, was an artist at heart. She loved colors, fonts, shapes, and patterns. CSS had a keen eye for design and aesthetics. With her stylesheets, she added flair and personality to their creations, making them visually appealing and captivating. She could transform a plain HTML structure into a stunning masterpiece with just a few lines of code.<br>

Together, HTML and CSS formed a dynamic duo, each complementing the other's strengths. They understood each other perfectly, knowing when to step in and support one another. HTML provided the structure, while CSS added the style, creating a harmonious balance that made their web projects shine.<br>

Despite their differences, HTML and CSS shared a deep bond. They respected each other's talents and appreciated the unique contributions they brought to their work. HTML admired CSS's creativity and artistic flair, while CSS admired HTML's organization and logical thinking.<br>
</p>

<h4>2. Any moments of surprise or joy?</h4> <br>
<p>
YEs, learning HTML and CSS was a fun thing to do and I enjoyed every bit of it. <br>
</p>

<h4>3. If HTML and CSS were animals, which animals do you think they would be? Why?<br></h4>
<p>
HTML as an Ant: Ants are known for their diligent and organized nature when constructing intricate and complex colonies. Similarly, HTML serves as the foundational structure for web pages, organizing content in a structured manner that forms the backbone of the webpage.<br>

CSS as a Chameleon: Chameleons are famous for their ability to adapt and blend into their environment seamlessly by changing colors and patterns. Similarly, CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is responsible for the visual presentation of web pages, allowing developers to style and design elements to seamlessly integrate into the overall look and feel of the website. Like a chameleon, CSS adapts to the design needs of different websites, making them visually appealing and engaging.<br>

Just as ants work tirelessly to construct intricate colonies and chameleons adapt to their surroundings, HTML and CSS work together to build visually appealing and functional websites on the internet.
