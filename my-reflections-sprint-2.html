<h2>My Blog</h2> 
<br>
<h3>Can you describe the steps you did in this exercise in simple terms?</h3>
<br>
<p>
To set up my own blog using html and CSS. First, I created a blog directory for html files under joy-gamayon.github.io, and created a file name te-houtaewa-template.html with a template content pasted on VS code. Secondly, I created another directory called styles for CSS files, and created a main.css file inside the directory. <br>
<br>
These two files HTML AND CSS would be added, commited and pushed to GitHub. Also, these two would be linked together using VS code in order to create a unique and wondeful design for my Blog, which I would be creating for this activity.<br>
</p><br>
<h3>How are you finding working with the timeboxes?</h3>
<br>
<p>I find the timebox recommeded great, as it helped me manage my time in a timely manner. <br>
  I had enough time to go through setting up html and CSS. It was a bit easy and I was confident creating it as I already know the process and the workflow  in GitHub, and I had enough knowledge about HTML and CSS.</p><br>
<br>

<h2>Learn HTML and CSS</h2>
<br>
<h3>What obstacles did you come up against? How did you overcome them?</h3>
<br>
<p>There were a few certain topics that I got confused with such as the variables and media queries as I haven't learned about it before.<br>
   However, I managed to solve the problems by reading and understanding it again and finding out where I was mistaken.</p><br>
<br>
<h3>What are of you proud of from this challenge?</h3>
<br>
<p>To be honest, I was proud of myself for finishing these activities within 4-5 hours. I felt confident and was feeling excited when doing this challenge.<br>
  I was doing great solving problems in learning the basic introduction of HTML and CSS. It really helped the self studies I did before taking this course.<br>
  I am glad I learned abit of HTML and CSS as it made it a bit easier for me to do this challenge.</p><br>
<br>

<h2>DevTools Tutorial</h2>
<br>
<h3>What did you notice about your learning style, strengths, and limitations when doing this crash course?</h3>
<br>
<p>I noticed that crash courses often require quick adaptation to new information and concepts. Learning through visual aid such as videos, charts, and diagrams were helpful for me to understand complex topics in a short time. As well as, Practical exercises which it enhanced my learning by providing real-world application of theoretical concept. Though, it was a bit confusing to understand and rememeber the whole crash courses, as most of it was new to me. Additionally, listening to a lecture was beneficial for someone like me as a new learner.<br>

I noticed that I was able to focus on learning this crash crouse with a limited timeframe and motivated myself to get this course done. I managed to follow the instructions given and solve problems during the course, and was able to learn and gain some knowledge quickly.<br>

The limitation that I noticed for doing this crash course, is that I feel a bit stressed because of the pressure that I needed to learn quickly. Also, for being over-whelmed due to rapid exposure to vast amounts of information, which resulted in not being able to process the informations efficiently.</p><br>

<h3>Did any blocks come up for you? How did you overcome them?</h3>
<br>
<p>Yes, with the limited time, I found myself struggling to cover all the materials thoroughly. To overcome this, prioritizing key concepts and allocating time effectively to each topic could help me ensure essential informations are covered.</p><br>
<br>
Due to complex topics covered in crash courses, it gave me confusion and difficulty in understanding it. I think by breaking down complex concepts into smaller, more manageable chunks and seeking clarification through additional resources or asking questions can aid comprehension.<br>
</p>
<br>
<h3>How many tabs do you have open in your web browser right now? What is the ratio of study related tabs to distraction related tabs?</h3>
<br>
<p>I think I had atleast 10 tabs open on my web brower right now, which are all related to my study for this course. I tend to leave most of the resources I needed from Sprint 2 activities, and go back to it if I needed more information and clarification about certain topics. This would be much easier for me to find things quickly.</p><br>

<h3>Did you do something funny with the Dev Tools, like insert your own name into the DOM of a website? If not, try it out.</h3>
<br>
<p>I actually did type out random names or words on DOM. I just wanted to try out and create something on my own, and then, I would go back to following the instructions on youtube right after.</p><br>


<h2>Add HTML and CSS to your Blog Challenge</h2>
<br>
<h3>Write a small story about HTML and CSS and their relationship. You could personify elements or speak from your own personal experience. The story should capture insight about the nature of HTML and CSS.</h3> 
  <br>
  <br>
<p>
  Once upon a time in the vast kingdom of the World Wide Web, there existed two inseparable friends named HTML and CSS. HTML, short for HyperText Markup Language, was the backbone of every webpage. It provided the structure, the bones upon which the content was built. CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, was HTML's faithful companion, bringing beauty and elegance to their creations.<br>
<br>
HTML was a practical and straightforward fellow. He loved organizing things, creating hierarchies, and laying out the foundation of their web projects. With his tags and elements, he defined headings, paragraphs, lists, and more. HTML was like the architect of the web, carefully planning and constructing the framework for their digital world.<br>
<br>
CSS, on the other hand, was an artist at heart. She loved colors, fonts, shapes, and patterns. CSS had a keen eye for design and aesthetics. With her stylesheets, she added flair and personality to their creations, making them visually appealing and captivating. She could transform a plain HTML structure into a stunning masterpiece with just a few lines of code.<br>
<br>
Together, HTML and CSS formed a dynamic duo, each complementing the other's strengths. They understood each other perfectly, knowing when to step in and support one another. HTML provided the structure, while CSS added the style, creating a harmonious balance that made their web projects shine.<br>
<br>
Despite their differences, HTML and CSS shared a deep bond. They respected each other's talents and appreciated the unique contributions they brought to their work. HTML admired CSS's creativity and artistic flair, while CSS admired HTML's organization and logical thinking.</p><br>
<br>
<h3>Any moments of surprise or joy?</h3>
<br>
<p>YEs, learning HTML and CSS was a fun thing to do and I enjoyed every bit of it.

</p> 
<br>

<h3>If HTML and CSS were animals, which animals do you think they would be? Why?</h3>
<br>
<p>HTML as an Ant: Ants are known for their diligent and organized nature when constructing intricate and complex colonies. Similarly, HTML serves as the foundational structure for web pages, organizing content in a structured manner that forms the backbone of the webpage.<br>
<br>
CSS as a Chameleon: Chameleons are famous for their ability to adapt and blend into their environment seamlessly by changing colors and patterns. Similarly, CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is responsible for the visual presentation of web pages, allowing developers to style and design elements to seamlessly integrate into the overall look and feel of the website. Like a chameleon, CSS adapts to the design needs of different websites, making them visually appealing and engaging.<br>
<br>
Just as ants work tirelessly to construct intricate colonies and chameleons adapt to their surroundings, HTML and CSS work together to build visually appealing and functional websites on the internet.</p><br>
