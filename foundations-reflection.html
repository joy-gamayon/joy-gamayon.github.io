  <h2>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h2>
  <br>
  <p>
      I've noticed that I've become more patient and persistent as I've embarked on my journey to learn web development.
      Everything is so new to me, and there's a ton of complex information to absorb. Instead of getting frustrated when things get tough,
      I've learned to be patient with myself and keep pushing forward. I'm sticking with it, even when it's challenging, and that persistence is helping me progress.
      <br>
      <br>
      This course has really shown me how to think creatively when solving problems. Every time I work on technology activities, I'm improving my problem-solving skills. 
      Whether it's fixing bugs in my code or trying to grasp new concepts, I'm learning how to find solutions and troubleshoot.
      This process is teaching me to adapt to different situations and think carefully about how to tackle challenges.
      <br>
      <br>
      This journey has taught me to stay positive even when I make mistakes. 
      Having a growth mindset has allowed me to overcome challenges along the way.
      I've learned that it's alright not to have all the answers and that every mistake is a chance to get better.
      This mindset is helping me face challenges with an open and resilient attitude.
  </p>



  <h2>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h2>
  <br>
  <p>
      Values:
      <br>
      Knowing what's important to me can keep me motivated and focused on my learning path. 
      If what I'm learning matches up with what matters to me, I'm more likely to keep going and stay interested.
      <br>
      My values affect the choices I make when I'm coding and how I move forward with my learning every day.
      They guide how I solve problems and make decisions in my programming projects.
      <br>
      Empathy:
      <br>
      Being able to understand how others feel helps me talk and work better with my peers and users.
      It lets me see things from their point of view and learn from what they say, making it easier to communicate and work together.
      <br>
      Empathy is really important in programming because it helps me work well with my team.
      By understanding what my teammates are going through, I can better understand their needs and preferences when we're working on projects together.
      <br>
      Self-awarness:
      <br>
      Knowing myself is important in my learning because it helps me see what I'm good at and where I need to improve. 
      It helps me figure out the best way for me to learn and find the right resources that work for me.
      <br>
      Understanding myself is crucial, especially in programming. It helps me see where I need to get better and grow.
      By looking at how I code and asking for advice from my peers, I can develop my skills at programming.
      Also, being aware of myself can help me handle stress, stay on track, and balance my work and personal life in the fast-paced web development industry.
  </p>

  <h2>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h2>
  <br>
  <p>
    I was surprised by how important it was to use human skills in learning this course.
    But I'm glad I learned them because it's not just helping me in my studies, it's also helping me become a better person. 
    It's changed how I do things every day and how I learn, which will also help me in my future job.
  </p>


  <h2>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h2>
  <br>
  <p>      
    For me, the hardest part was sticking to the time limits, and managing my time well. 
    It's tough to stick to the recommended time, especially when I'm working on tough exercises. 
    I find it a bit tough to manage my time well and reach my goals efficiently, especially when it comes to adopting new habits.
  </p>


  <h2>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h2>
  <br>
  <p>
    Dev Academy wants to help students develop certain habits and use them in the web development industry. 
    They think it's not just about having a great coding skills but also about adapting and attaining human skills. 
    Having these core skills could potentially help students become great programmers and succeed in the future.
  </p>


  <h2>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h2>
  <br>
  <p>
    I don't think the time I spent studying core learning was a waste. Both core learning and practicing programming are important.
    However, I feel I could benefit more from spending extra time practicing coding, especially for complex topics. 
    Adding more practice and lectures would help me improve my coding skills even further based on my situation.
