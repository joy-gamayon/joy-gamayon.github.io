          It was hard for me to solve JavaScript problems. I felt overwhelmed trying to remember all the instructions and methods. I was trying to learn too much too fast, and it made my thoughts all mixed up.
          <br>
          I got stuck trying to figure out how to loop through certain parts of an array. I didn't know which method or code to use.
          <br>
          It took me a long time to solve each problem. I felt like I was just sitting at my computer, not making any progress.
          <br>
          To try and do better, I went back to the basics and looked over old exercises. I searched on Google for help with specific array methods. I also checked out resources like MDN and W3Schools.
          <br>
          I asked for help in Discord channels, like the help desk and after-hours support. I wanted to see if others were having the same problems.
          <br>
          I tried writing out my problems in simple steps using pseudocode, but it was tough to know where to start. Still, it helped me think clearly once I figured out the solution.
          <br>
          Throughout the exercise, I've been learning how to solve problems. I kept testing my code until I got the right answers. Writing pseudocode helped me understand each step and method I used.
          <br>
          As well as, rubberducking which helped me figure out simple problems with my code, especially wrong typos and using wrong syntax.
          <br>

              <br>
              It was tough, but I managed to solve a problem elegantly for a few questions. It felt really good when I got the answers right without too much trouble.
              <br>
              I followed the instructions carefully and tackled each problem one step at a time.
              <br>
              For example, I created an empty value for a property in an object and made variables with values, then added them to an array. 
              <br>
              It was smooth sailing, and I got the answers correct. Also, using the pseudocode made my methods clear and easy to understand.
              <br>

              Throughout the JavaScript-kata activities, I've used different problem-solving techniques. I feel pretty confident searching things on Google. 
              <br>
              It helps me find methods and examples for my questions. I'm also good at rubber ducking, even though I didn't realize it before.
              <br>
              I often explain my problems to my partner, and it helps me figure things out.
              <br>
              Using pseudocode has been really helpful for me. It makes my code clearer and easier to understand.
              <br>
              I feel confident using this method, and I'll keep using it in the course.
              <br>
              But reading error messages and using console.log still make me feel unsure. Sometimes, I can't figure out complicated error messages, 
              <br>
              and I didn't use console.log much during the exercises. I found it easier to run and test my code in the terminal. I am also still learning to know how to ask some help from peers and coaches; take some courage becasue it is still challenging for me.
              <br>

            <br>
            <br>
            Asking for help from peers and coaches is still a bit hard for me. I usually want to solve problems on my own and learn from my mistakes.
            <br>
            But I realize I get frustrated when I don't ask for help. I always end up wasting my time trying to figure out the solutions instead of just asking some help.
            <br>
            I'm afraid of asking simple questions or being judged. I know asking for help would make things easier,
            <br>
            so I need to work on having the courage to ask questions without worrying.
