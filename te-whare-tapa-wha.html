        <p>
            To improve my physical wellbeing, I often go for a body massage 2-3 times a month.
            <br>
            Taking a hot bath at home every night time before I go to bed.
            <br>
            I work out 2-3 times a week during night time.
            <br>
            This is for my body to recover from muscle pain, stress and overall wellbeing of my physical health.

            I normally takecare of my mental health the same way as how I takecare of my physical health. I go for massage and work out to release some stress.
            <br>
            I always listen to music such as hillsongs (worships) before going to bed.
            <br>
            Taking a break from work and go to the beach and catching up with some friends once a week.
            <br>
            Having an alone time with myself, eating my favourite food and watching my favourite movies or dramas every day off.

            To improve my spritual health, I normally go to Church every Sundays to connect with God.
            <br>
            I pray and listen to some worship or calming songs every night before going to sleep.
            <br>
            This helps me spiritually connected with my body and mind, giving me a sense of calmness and peace of mind.
            <br>
            Also, spending time with nature every once a week and having an alone time with myself to reflect and to meditate everyday.

          Every once a week, I spend time with my family and friends. I go to Church with my family every Sunday.
          <br>
          I always have a get together with my relatives and other family members every weekend. Like having a bbq party and going to the beach or any family activities.
          <br>
          I always attend my friends special ocassions and always try to make time for them, through video calls or chats and catching up with them.
          <br>
          Offering support and help towards my community, family and friends. This interaction improves my relationship towards them and build stronger connections.

            Our house itself has a lot of plants. We love to have plants inside our home because it gives positive atmosphere.
            <br>
            It brings good luck and good health to our family and to our home.
            <br>
            I like to spend time with nature every now and then by going to some parks, sitting or lying on a grass while listening to music or the sound of trees or birds and watching the sky.
            <br>
            As well as, going to the beach and lying on the sand while listening to the waves. I normally connect with nature when I need 
            <br>
            to be away from stressful environment, and needing some time alone to reconnect with myself and to my body and soul.
