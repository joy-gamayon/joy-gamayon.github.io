    <h3>1.	Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.</h3><br>
    <br>
    <p>
        A few years ago, while working at a previous job, I encountered a situation where a colleague inadvertently left confidential client information on their desk. 
        This information included sensitive financial data that could potentially harm the client if it fell into the wrong hands. As I noticed this, I faced a dilemma: 
        whether to respect my colleague's privacy and overlook the issue or to take action to ensure the security of the client's information.<br>
        <br>
        In weighing up the values involved, I considered the importance of client confidentiality, trustworthiness, and integrity.
        I also reflected on the potential consequences of either action ignoring the situation could risk breaching client confidentiality and damaging the reputation of our organization,
        while acting might strain my relationship with my colleague and lead to uncomfortable confrontations.<br>
        <br>
        After careful consideration, I decided to address the issue discreetly with my colleague.
        I approached them in a non-confrontational manner, expressing concern about the unintentional disclosure of confidential information and helping in securing it properly. 
        My intention was not to blame or shame my colleague but to collaborate on finding a solution that prioritized the protection of our clients' data.<br>
        <br>
        Looking back on the decision now, I believe it was the right course of action. By addressing the issue proactively and respectfully, 
        I upheld ethical principles of confidentiality and integrity while also maintaining a positive working relationship with my colleague.
        The experience reinforced the importance of being vigilant about ethical considerations in the workplace and approaching such situations with empathy and professionalism.

    <h3>2.	Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.</h3><br>
    <br>
    <p>
        My culture and the people around me play a significant role in shaping my identity and values. 
        Growing up I was exposed to a particular cultural context through traditions, norms, customs, and shared beliefs, in which influences how I perceive the world and my place within it. 
        Similarly, the interactions and relationships I have with my family, friends, mentors, and other individuals contribute to shaping my values and sense of self.<br>
        <br>
        For instance, my parents and other family members would often imprint foundational values to me and to my siblings through teachings and behaviours 
        such as showing respect, honesty, kindness, and compassion to one another and to other people. 
        These values would serve as my guiding principles as I navigate various life situations and making decisions.<br>
        <br>
        Additionally, interacting with group members and social circles could also influence my identity and values as a person.
        Peers who share the same values and have similar beliefs, interests or backgrounds could strengthen my certain values and norms while challenging others. 
        This dynamic process would continuously influence throughout my daily life, shaping my values and identities in complex ways.<br>
        <br>
        Moreover, it could broaden my understanding and appreciation of different values and identities 
        when I am exposed to diverse cultures, experiences, and perspectives in life and other individuals. 
        This kind of exposures would encourage tolerance, empathy, and cultural sensitivity, helping to create a worldview that is more complex and inclusive.<br>

    <h3>3.	Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey.</h3><br>
    <br>
    <p>
        Resilience: Resilience enables me to bounce back from setbacks and learn from failures. It helps me view challenges as opportunities for growth rather than obstacles to success, fostering a positive attitude towards learning.<br>
        <br>
        Self-awareness: Being self-aware allows me to recognize my strengths and weaknesses, enabling me to tailor my learning approach accordingly.
        I can capitalize on my strengths while actively addressing areas where I need improvement.<br>
        <br>
        Curiosity: I have a natural curiosity, which drives me to explore new topics and seek out additional information, leading to a deeper understanding of the subjects I am studying.<br>
        <br>
        Persistence: Being persistent means I won't give up easily when faced with challenges or setbacks. This strength will help me persevere through difficult concepts or tasks, ultimately leading to mastery.<br>

    <h3>4. Evaluate my limitations in terms of my learning and career development. How might these affect my learning journey?</h3><br>
    <br>
    <p>
        Lack of time: If I have limited time due to work, family responsibilities, or other commitments, it can hinder my ability to dedicate sufficient time to learning and skill development. 
        This may result in slower progress or difficulty keeping up with coursework or training programs.<br>
        <br>
        Fear of failures:  Fear of failure or rejection can paralyze my willingness to take risks, try new things, or pursue ambitious goals. 
        It may lead to procrastination, self-doubt, or avoidance behaviours that impede my learning and career advancement.<br>

    <h3>5. Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension.
          <br>     
          Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.
   </h3>
    <br>
    <p>
        While working on a group project during my University years, I experienced tension within the team due to conflicting ideas and communication breakdowns. 
        Despite our shared goal of completing the project successfully, differing opinions on the approach and division of tasks led to frustration and resistance among team members.<br>
        <br>
        At the time, I tried several strategies to address the tension and improve collaboration:<br>
        <br>
        Open Communication: I initiated open discussions to encourage team members to voice their concerns, share their perspectives, and find common ground. 
        However, this approach was only partially effective, as some team members were reluctant to express their opinions or engage in constructive dialogue.<br>
        <br>
        Compromise and flexibility: I suggested compromises and adjustments to accommodate different viewpoints and preferences within the team. 
        While this helped alleviate some tension temporarily, it didn't fully resolve the underlying issues or prevent further conflicts from arising.<br>
        <br>
        Setting clear expectations:  I clarified roles, responsibilities, and deadlines to ensure everyone understood their tasks and contributions to the project. 
        While this helped improve organization and accountability to some extent, it didn't address deeper interpersonal dynamics or communication barriers.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Reflecting on this experience, I recognize that while these strategies were well-intentioned, they were not entirely effective in resolving the underlying tension and resistance within the team.
        In hindsight, here are some additional strategies I would consider implementing:<br>
        <br>
        Building trust and rapport: I would focus on building trust and rapport among team members by fostering a supportive and inclusive team environment. 
        This could involve team-building activities, regular check-ins, and opportunities for social interaction outside of formal meetings.<br>
        <br>
        Overall, I've learned that navigating interpersonal dynamics and resolving conflicts requires patience, empathy, and proactive communication. 
        By continuously refining my interpersonal skills and adopting a collaborative mindset, I can better navigate challenges and foster a positive and productive team environment in future collaborative endeavours.<br>
